Solaris Mobile App is used for manually tilting solar panels according to the user location and their date time. We use the <b>Gyroscope</b> and the <b>Magnetometer</b> sensors of the device to detect the proper tilt.

You can download the app here [Apk drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/170HMrigXFpZwzHW3F4FIAJt-gC9HfU5Z/view?usp=sharing)
## Project Overview

SOLARIS app helps users to know the optimal direction and angle to install the solar panel and get the maximum amount of energy. 

Our users just have to place their phones on top of their solar panels and the app will intuitively guide them to the optimal <b>Rotation</b> and the optimal <b>Tilt Angle</b> for that location at that particular time.

## Content

#### 1. Home Page
The home page has 3 options
- I want to place a new solar panel=> will get your location 
- I have Solaris Auto Tracking Panel => Coming Soon
- I want to adjust my solar panel manually => will get your location 

#### 2. Location Page 

- The location page has a map with marker
- You need to drag the marker to set you location
- After you set your location you need to point your phone in the right direction

#### 3. Info Page 

- This page shows the optimum tilt angle for the user's current location and (Daily/Monthly) Energy gain 
- You can press (eye icon) to know the direction and tilt for your solar panel 

#### 4. Compass Page 

- This page will guide you to direction of panel rotation.
- You need to point the arrow up .

#### 5. Tilt Page

- This Page will guide you to set up your panel with optimum tilt angle .
- You should place the phone parallel to the panel . 
- You must make the ball between the two lines .
